## How to run Variant Organiser

Variant Organiser is keyboard operated:

**→** Select a main component with variants.

**→** Type `⌘` + `/` to open Figma’s quick actions search bar (or `CRTL` + `/` if you are on Windows).

**→** Start typing “Variant Organiser” to search for and run the plugin.

**→** Follow the prompts:
1. Select which property to use for **columns** in the primary grid
2. Select which property to use for **rows** in the primary grid. If your component only has two properties, that's sufficient to arrange the variants in a simple grid. If you have more properties, this grid will be repeated within a larger grid.  
3. Hit `Tab` to if you want to chose a property to generate **horizontal blocks**. This step is optional.
4. Hit `Enter` to generate the full grid structure. Any remaining properties will be used to group variants vertically.
